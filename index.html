                    <h2>This site</h2>
                    <p>This is just a quick site I threw together in a couple of days as a basic display of my knowledge of the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as my knowledge of the p5.js library. It was also created to show some of my knowledge regarding web design and color choice. I used some computer generated art that I made using the p5.js library as some filler content. In the future I may expand this site to display my portfolio.</p>
